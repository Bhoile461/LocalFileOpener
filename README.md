# FileOpener Backend Installer

This repository contains the source and installer for the backend component used by the [Local Network File Open Edge Extension](ID: polnepdgmkkmpeeanjpeloecppfobogh).
(extension in review)

## üîç Overview

The MSI installer installs a local batch file and registers a custom URL protocol (`fileopen://`) so that files can be opened from the browser using the extension.
The extension will convert clicked links that correspond with the various local (`file://`) link formats to (`fileopen://`) to be routed by this program.
This, alongside the extension, allows opening direct file links from the browser so as to open the original copy.

This program and extension was crafted to be used for in-house productivity/utility purposes

### Installed Components
